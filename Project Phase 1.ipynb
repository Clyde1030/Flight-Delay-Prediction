    "The objective of this project is to build a flight delay prediction system that classifies upcoming flight departures into delay categories no delay and delay to support airport management - leading to more efficient logistics operations and providing better passenger experience. Using the Databricks PaaS environment, the project leverages the starter notebook and cluster setup for data exploration, checkpointing, and modeling. The primary data sources are the U.S. Department of Transportation for flight delay information (2015–2021) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for weather data covering the same period. Preliminary exploratory analysis shows strong correlations between delay duration and factors such as poor weather visibility, precipitation, congestion at major hubs, and peak-hour departures. We also plan to utilize other factors like holidays and government shutdown to make this prediction more accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project frames delay prediction as a classification task, addressing the question “Is there a flight delay?” Predictions will be made up to two hours before scheduled departure, enabling proactive planning and passenger communication. We will train and evaluate models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier using the integrated Spark MLlib and SparkXGBClassifier libraries on Databricks. Evaluation metrics will include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Log loss and F1-Score. This approach supports operational decision-making, allowing airports to anticipate disruptions, allocate ground staff efficiently, and improve on-time performance tracking. Future extensions may include temporal features, route-based clustering, and real-time streaming predictions for airport operations dashboards."

    "## Machine Algorithms and Metrics\n",
    "### Problem Choice and Rationale\n",
    "***Classification*** answers *“Is the flight actually delayed?”* This is useful for setting expectations (passengers, crews) when an alert of a delay is issued or can be considered for the airport management. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we will predict whether a flight will depart on time or have a delay greater than or equal to 30 minutes using information available **two hours before the scheduled departure**. We will use a binary decision rule threshold of 30 minutes to classify flights. That is, given the parameters for a certain flight, the flight can be predicted as either delayed or not delayed given the output binary classification based on the departure delay minutes threshold. This way, airport management can conduct further analysis on resources that they will need to be prepared for the departure delay for their next steps. This framing directly serves operational needs (early alerts for airlines/airports) and supports capacity-constrained decision making (limited alert budget).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following classification based machine learning models will be used to predict the departure delay (**`DEP_DELAY`**) to provide granular ETA (expected time available) updates where needed, deciding if the departure is to be delayed or not. We plan to use a baseline of the `majority class` for the models to compare against in addition to comparing each model to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms (Names, Implementations, Loss/Criteria)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Random Forest \n",
    "- **Description:** Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees trained on bootstrap samples; at each split a random subset of features is considered. Trees vote to produce class probabilities.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** Apache Spark MLlib `RandomForestClassifier` (Databricks).\n",
    "- **Loss/Criteria:**\n",
    "  - *Entropy (per tree):*\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    H(S) = -\\sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k \\log p_k\n",

    "  The tree grows by maximizing impurity reduction (information gain).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Justification:** Strong baseline on tabular, mixed-type, nonlinear data; robust to noise; handles interactions between schedule, route, and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) XGBoost\n",
    "- **Description:** XGBoost is a supervised machine learning algorithm known as Extreme Gradient Boosting that uses gradient boosted decision trees with ensemble learning.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** From xgboost's spark library, `SparkXGBClassifier` (databricks)\n",
    "- **Loss/Criteria:**\n",
    "  - *Log Loss:*\n",

    "    $$ \n",
    "- **Justification:** Works mixed and nonlinear data, and we can select either ridge or lasso regularizations to prevent overfitting; handles interactions between schedule, route, and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Logistic Regression\n",
    "- **Description:** The supervised machine learning model that is used for classifying a binary outcome given the input variables.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** Apache Spark MLlib's binomial `LogisticRegression`.\n",

    "    $$ \n",

    "### Classification Metrics (With Equations) and Analysis\n",

    "EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed on OTPW data and secondary data that include US holiday information to generate summary statistics and initial data visualizations. Next, we will develop data pipelines to address outliers, missing and duplicated values, and encode categorical features. We will allocate 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. Because different models may require different feature engineering strategies, we will create a dedicated pipeline for each model - for example, standardizing numerical features for logistic regression. \n",

We will train multiple ML models and perform model selection using cross-validation, reserving 20% of the training data for validation. We will evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters using the predefined performance metrics. The entire process will iterate until satisfactory model performance is achieved. Finally, we will evaluate the generalizability of the final ML models on the testing set.\n",
